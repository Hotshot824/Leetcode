### [454. 4Sum II]

Because this problem only needs to count how many groups of numbers sum to zero, so can use hash to solution. 
1. Create a map, traverse the combination of num1 and num2 and record the sum in the map as the key, 
and the value is the number of occurrences.
2. Traverse the combination of num3 and num4, if `target - (num3 + num4)` exist in map, 
Indicates the number of times a value for this field can add up to zero, record to count and return it at last.

This time complexity is O(n<sup>2</sup>) + O(n<sup>2</sup>) = O(n<sup>2</sup>).

```go
func fourSumCount(nums1 []int, nums2 []int, nums3 []int, nums4 []int) int {
	var count int
	hash := map[int]int{}
	for _, i := range nums1 {
		for _, j := range nums2 {
			hash[i+j]++
		}
	}
	for _, i := range nums3 {
		for _, j := range nums4 {
			if val, ok := hash[0-(i+j)]; ok {
				count += val
			}
		}
	}
	return count
}

```
