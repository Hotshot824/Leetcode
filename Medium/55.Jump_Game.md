### [55. Jump Game]

Only need to know the maximum coverage area, you don't need to think about where you jumped from, just find a place you can jump to.
Detail reference the diagram:  

![55. diagram]


This time complexity is O(n).
```go
func canJump(nums []int) bool {
	var cover int = 0
	// Nums has only one element, the starting point is the end point.
	if len(nums) == 1 {
		return true
	}
	for i := 0; i <= cover; i++ {
		cover = max(cover, i+nums[i])
		if cover >= len(nums)-1 {
			return true
		}
	}
	return false
}

func max(i, j int) int {
	if i > j {
		return i
	}
	return j
}
```

### [45. Jump Game II]

Create a cover and maxcover, if the cover cannot be moved to `len(nums)` (the last element of nums), 
it means that the jump time must be +1. And max cover is stored in the largest coverage range in this round of cover, and `maxcover - cover` is the next cover range.

```go
func jump(nums []int) int {
	var cover, maxcover, time int = 0, 0, 0
	// Nums has only one element, the starting point is the end point.
	for i := 0; i <= cover; i++ {
		maxcover = max(maxcover, i+nums[i])
		if cover >= len(nums)-1 {
			return time
		}
		if i == cover {
			time++
			cover += maxcover - cover
		}
	}
	return 0
}

func max(i, j int) int {
	if i > j {
		return i
	}
	return j
}
```
