### [455. Assign Cookies]

Problem statement:
```
Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.
```

1.	Solution:  
Use the **greedy algorithm** to sort the two arrays, big cookie for big greedy, find the best solution.  
Time complexity is O(nlogn), Space complexity is O(1).
```go
func findContentChildren(g []int, s []int) int {
	sort.Ints(g)
	sort.Ints(s)

	child := 0
    // Content children in order from small to large.
	for sIndex := 0; child < len(g) && sIndex < len(s); sIndex++ {
		if s[sIndex] >= g[child] {
			child++
		}
	}
	return child
}
```
