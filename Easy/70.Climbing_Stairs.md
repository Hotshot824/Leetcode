### [70. Climbing Stairs]

Problem statement:
```
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.  
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
```

1.  Represent this staircase as an array.  
`s[i]` as an array, `i = stair level`, `s[i] = How many ways to reach this stair level`.
2.  Calculate the number of methods used

| level(n) | steps | ways |
| :----: | ---- | :----: |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 1x2, 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 1x3, 1+2, 2+1 | 3 |
| 4 | 1x4, 1+1+2, 1+2+1, 2+1+1, 2x2 | 5 | 
| 5 | 1x5, 1+1+1+2, 1+1+2+1, 1+2+1+1, 2+1+1+1, 1+2+2, 2+1+2, 2+2+1 | 8 |

3. Discover the rules  
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21  
where the rules are `s[i] = s[i-1] + s[i-2]`.

Solution:  
```go
func climbStairs(n int) int {
	if n <= 3 {
		return n
	}
	a, b := 2, 3
	for i := 4; i <= n; i++ {
		a, b = b, a+b
	}
	return b
}
```
