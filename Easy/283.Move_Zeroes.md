### [283. Move Zeroes]

The same solution as question 27, just change to delete 0.
The time complexity is O(n).

>Tip. In golang array and slice are pass-by-reference.

```go
func moveZeroes(nums []int) {
	slowindex := 0
	for i := 0; i < len(nums); i++ {
		if nums[i] != 0 {
			nums[slowindex] = nums[i]
			slowindex++
		}
	}
	for ; slowindex < len(nums); slowindex++ {
		nums[slowindex] = 0
	}
}
```
