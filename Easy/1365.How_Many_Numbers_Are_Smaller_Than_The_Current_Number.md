[1365. How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number]

Brute force to solution, using two for loop, Time complexity is O(n<sup>2</sup>).  

```go
func smallerNumbersThanCurrent(nums []int) []int {
	var result []int
	for i := 0; i < len(nums); i++ {
		var count int = 0
		for j := 0; j < len(nums); j++ {
			if i == j {
				continue
			}
			if nums[i] > nums[j] {
				count++
			}
		}
		result = append(result, count)
	}
	return result
}

```
