### [1518. Water Bottles]

The simple solution is simulating the process of drinking water. Drink all the water, exchange the empty bottles for new bottles, 
and repeat the process until there are not enough bottles to exchange.

Time O(log(numBottles)), Space: O(1).

**Solution:**
```go
func numWaterBottles(numBottles int, numExchange int) int {
    res := 0
    for numBottles >= numExchange {
        remain := numBottles % numExchange
        exchange := numBottles / numExchange
        res += numBottles-remain
        numBottles = remain+exchange
    }
    return res + numBottles
}
```

**Recursive Solution:**
-   Practice to write a recursive solution, but performance is not better than previous solution.
```go
func numWaterBottles(numBottles int, numExchange int) int {
    if numBottles < numExchange {
        return numBottles
    }
    exchange := numBottles / numExchange
    remain := numBottles % numExchange
    return (numBottles-remain) + numWaterBottles(exchange + remain, numExchange)
}

```

#### Math Solution

1.  Initially, we have *b* bottles.
2.  We can exchange *b* bottles for *b/e* new bottles and *b%e* empty bottles.
3.  Keep this process until we have less than *e* bottles.

-   Is a geometric series where, the exchange can be represented as:
    -   1 + 1/e + 1/e<sup>2</sup> + ... + 1/e<sup>n</sup>
    -   So exchange must be integer part of loge(b).
-   Geometry series sum formula is:
    -   S<sub>n</sub> = a(1 - r<sup>n</sup>) / (1 - r)
-   In this problem:
    -   a = b/e
    -   r = 1/e
    -   n = loge(b)
-   So the total number of bottles drunk is:
    -   b + (b/e (1-1 / e<sup>loge(b)</sup>)) / (1 - 1/e)
    -   b + (b-1) / (e-1)
    -   (eb-1) / (e-1)

Time Complexity O(1), Space: O(1).

**Math Solution:**
```go
func numWaterBottles(numBottles int, numExchange int) int {
    return (numBottles * numExchange - 1) / (numExchange - 1)
}
```

### [3100. Water Bottles II]

Same as the previous problem, but the number of bottles to exchange is increasing by 1 each time.

Time O(numBottles), Space: O(1).

**Solution:**
```go
func maxBottlesDrunk(numBottles int, numExchange int) int {
    if numExchange > numBottles {
        return numBottles
    }
    res := 0
    for numBottles >= numExchange {
        numBottles -= numExchange
        res += numExchange
        numExchange++
        numBottles++
    }
    return res + numBottles
}
```
