### [206. Reverse Linked List]

Two pointer sloution, storage current.Next first, current.Next pointing prev, 
and then prev moves to current, current moves to Next, until traversal all node.
The time complexity is O(n).

```go
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * type ListNode struct {
 *     Val int
 *     Next *ListNode
 * }
 */
func reverseList(head *ListNode) *ListNode {
    current := head
    var prev *ListNode
    for current != nil {
        Next := current.Next
        current.Next = prev
        prev = current
        current = Next
    }
    return prev
}
```
